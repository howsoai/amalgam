The parameter value_names, if specified as a list of the names of the values, will transform via unzipping any assoc into a list for the respective parameter in the order of the value_names, or if a number will use the number repeatedly for every element.  weights is a list of dimension weights to use for the query, each value mapping to its respective element in the vectors.  If weights is null, then it will assume that the weights are 1 and additionally will ignore null values for the vectors instead of treating them as unknown differences.  The parameter distance_types is either a list strings or an assoc of strings indicating the type of distance for each feature.  Allowed values are \"nominal_numeric\", \"nominal_string\", \"nominal_code\", \"continuous_numeric\", \"continuous_numeric_cyclic\", \"continuous_string\", and \"continuous_code\".  Nominals evaluate whether the two values are the same and continuous evaluates the difference between the two values.  The numeric, string, or code modifier specifies how the difference is measured, and cyclic means it is a difference that wraps around.  \nFor attributes, the particular distance_types specifies what particular attributes are expected.  For a nominal distance_type, a number indicates the nominal count, whereas null will infer from the values given.  Cyclic requires a single value, which is the upper bound of the difference for the cycle range (e.g., if the value is 360, then the supremum difference between two values will be 360, leading 1 and 359 to have a difference of 2).\n  Deviations are used during distance calculation to specify uncertainty per-element, the minimum difference between two values prior to exponentiation.  Specifying null as a deviation is equivalent to setting each deviation to 0.  Each deviation for each feature can be a single value or a list.  If it is a single value, that value is used as the deviation and differences and deviations for null values will automatically computed from the data based on the maximum difference.  If a deviation is provided as a list, then the first value is the deviation, the second value is the difference to use when one of the values being compared is null, and the third value is the difference to use when both of the values are null.  If the third value is omitted, it will use the second value for both.  If both of the null values are omitted, then it will compute the maximum difference and use that for both.  For nominal types, the value for each feature can be a numeric deviation, an assoc, or a list.  If the value is an assoc it specifies deviation information, where each key of the assoc is the nominal value, and each value of the assoc can be a numeric deviation value, a list, or an assoc, with the list specifying either an assoc followed optionally by the default deviation.  This inner assoc, regardless of whether it is in a list, maps the value to each actual value's deviation.   If any vector value is null or evaluates to nan, or any of the differences between vector1 and vector2 evaluate to null or nan, then it will compute a corresponding maximum distance value based on the properties of the feature.  If surprisal space is true, which defaults to false, it will perform all computations in surprisal space.",

If weights is null, then it will assume that the weights are 1 and additionally will ignore null values for the vectors instead of treating them as unknown differences.

Allowed values are \"nominal_numeric\", \"nominal_string\", \"nominal_code\", \"continuous_numeric\", \"continuous_numeric_cyclic\", \"continuous_string\", and \"continuous_code\".  Nominals evaluate whether the two values are the same and continuous evaluates the difference between the two values.  The numeric, string, or code modifier specifies how the difference is measured, and cyclic means it is a difference that wraps around.  For attributes, the particular distance_types specifies what is expected.  For a nominal distance_type, a number indicates the nominal count, whereas null will infer from the values available.  For continuous, a null means unbounded where distance for a null will be computed automatically from the relevant data; a single number indicates the difference between a value and a null, a specified uncertainty.  Cyclic requires either a single value or a list of two values; a list of two values indicates that the first value, the lower bound, will wrap around to the upper bound, the second value specified; if only a single number is provided instead of a list, then it will assume that number for the upper bound and 0 for the lower bound.  For the string distance type, the value specified can be a number indicating the maximum possible string length, inferred if null is provided.  For code, the value specified can be a number indicating the maximum number of nodes in the code (including labels), inferred if null is provided.  Deviations contains numbers that are used during the distance calculation, per-element, prior to exponentiation.  Specifying null as deviations is equivalent to setting each deviation to 0. max_distance is the maximum distance allowed.

If called last with compute_on_contained_entities, then it returns an assoc of the entity ids with their distances.  If these distances are returned, then a transform may be applied to them based on distance_transform.

If it is a single value, that value is used as the deviation and differences and deviations for null values will automatically computed from the data based on the maximum difference.  If a deviation is provided as a list, then the first value is the deviation, the second value is the difference to use when one of the values being compared is null, and the third value is the difference to use when both of the values are null.  If the third value is omitted, it will use the second value for both.  If both of the null values are omitted, then it will compute the maximum difference and use that for both.  For nominal types, the value for each feature can be a numeric deviation, an assoc, or a list.  If the value is an assoc it specifies deviation information, where each key of the assoc is the nominal value, and each value of the assoc can be a numeric deviation value, a list, or an assoc, with the list specifying either an assoc followed optionally by the default deviation.  This inner assoc, regardless of whether it is in a list, maps the value to each actual value's deviation.  entities_returned specifies the number of entities to return. The optional radius_label parameter represents the label name of the radius of the entity (if the radius is within the distance, the entity is selected). The optional numerical_precision represents one of three values: \"precise\", which computes every distance with high numerical precision, \"fast\", which computes every distance with lower but faster numerical precison, and \"recompute_precise\", which computes distances quickly with lower precision but then recomputes any distance values that will be returned with higher precision.  If called last with compute_on_contained_entities, then it returns an assoc of the entity ids with their convictions.  A transform will be applied to these distances based on distance_transform.  If distance_transform is \"surprisal_to_prob\" then distances will be calculated as surprisals and will be transformed back into probabilities for aggregating, and then transformed back to surprisals.  If distance_transform is a number or omitted, which will default to 1.0, then it will be used as a parameter for a generalized mean (e.g., -1 yields the harmonic mean) to average the distances.  If entity_weight_label_name is specified, it will multiply the resulting value for each entity (after distance_weight_exponent, etc. have been applied) by the value in the label of entity_weight_label_name. If conviction_of_removal is true, then it will compute the conviction as if the entities specified by entity_ids_to_compute were removed; if false (the default), then will compute the conviction as if those entities were added or included. If output_sorted_list is not specified or is false, then it will return an assoc of entity string id as the key with the distance as the value; if output_sorted_list is true, then it will return a list of lists, where the first list is the entity ids and the second list contains the corresponding distances, where both lists are in sorted order starting with the closest or most important (based on whether distance_weight_exponent is positive or negative respectively).  If output_sorted_list is a string, then it will additionally return a list where the values correspond to the values of the labels for each respective entity. If output_sorted_list is a list of strings, then it will additionally return a list of values for each of the label values for each respective entity.",
